- 👋 Hi, I’m @edwinschild
- 👀 I’m interested in Windows Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub but don't understand why people/companies prefer GitHub over Azure Devops
   - No option to get 'vertical tabs'
   - No easy visibility on test results
   - No access to artifacts while workflow is still running
   - No stages in pipelines
   - Terrible UX
   - Runners don't provide info which are busy and what they are busy with. Compared to Azure Devops agents which show exact status/version etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HBK products
- 📫 How to reach me: If you don't know me, there is no reason to reach me

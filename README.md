- 👋 Hi, I’m @edwinschild
- 👀 I’m interested in Windows Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub but don't understand why people/companies prefer GitHub over Azure Devops
   - No option to get 'vertical tabs'
   - No easy visibility on test results
   - No access to artifacts while workflow is still running
   - No stages in pipelines
   - Terrible UX
   - Runners don't provide info which are busy and what they are busy with. Compared to Azure Devops agents which show exact status/version etc.
   - No way to see which tasks were executed by a specific runner
   - Output while running workflow doesn't show everything. Need to use the Raw log to view it
   - No idea how much time a single task takes
   - Uploading a folder to artifacts doesn't allow you to expand it as folder in the end result artifacts. Clicking it results immediately in downloading it
   - Secrets are not really a secret. In Azure Devops a pipeline needs to be approved in order to use a secret. In github any workflow can use a secret and therefor make it accessible
   - Case sensitive UI. When typing branchname who cares about upper and lower case
   - Required code reviewers is something GitHub isn't good at
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HBK products
- 📫 How to reach me: If you don't know me, there is no reason to reach me
